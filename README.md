## Pros and cons of Nx, Turborepo and Lerna tools
Below are just my experiences working in those tools. They can be inaccurate.   
### Lerna
✅ Supports both same and different versions of libraries (such as Angular, RxJs)   
✅ 100% Native. No need to change configuration of applications (such as angular.json) to make it work  
❌ Slow development efficiency. Rebuild everytime you make changes to common packages such as UI   
❌ No dependency graph   

### Nx
❌ Not supports  both same and different versions of libraries (such as Angular, RxJs). Only Monorepo.   
❌ Not native. Needs to change configuration of applications (such as angular.json).   
  Uses custom plugins instead of native angular/cli. Problems with adding new packages (such as ssr)   
✅ Very fast development efficiency   
✅ Poweful dependency graph   

### Turborepo
❌ Not supports both same and different versions of libraries (such as Angular, RxJs). Only Monorepo.   
✅ Native. No need to change configuration of applications (such as angular.json).   
✅ Fast development efficiency   
✅ Dependency graph  

## What is next?
Currently, the unit tests were not aded since the project was focused on main features such as module federation, managing state, intercommucation and so on. It can be started soon.
