## Pros and cons of Nx, Turborepo and Lerna tools
Below are just my experiences working in those tools. They can be inaccurate.   
### Lerna
✅ Supports both same and different versions of libraries (such as Angular, RxJs)   
✅ 100% Native. No need to change configuration of applications (such as angular.json) to make it work  
❌ Slow development efficiency. Rebuild everytime you make changes to common packages such as UI   
❌ No dependency graph   

### Nx
❌ Supports both same and different versions of libraries (such as Angular, RxJs). Only Monorepo.   
❌ Not native. Needs to change configuration of applications (such as angular.json).   
  Uses custom plugins instead of native angular/cli. Problems with adding new packages (such as ssr)   
✅ Very fast development efficiency   
✅ Poweful dependency graph   

### Turborepo
❌ Supports both same and different versions of libraries (such as Angular, RxJs). Only Monorepo.   
✅ Native. No need to change configuration of applications (such as angular.json).   
✅ Fast development efficiency   
✅ Dependency graph
